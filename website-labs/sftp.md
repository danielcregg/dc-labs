# How to install SFTP 

 

We want to be able to work on files on our laptop and then copy them over to our remote VM in the cloud. To enable this functionality, we use Secure File Transport Protocol (SFTP). You will need to install an SFTP client. The SFTP client we will use is WinSCP.  

## STEPS: 

1. Enable root login to your remote VM by running the following commands on your VM. Make sure you have SSHâ€™ed into your VM. You can copy the following 3 commands all together and paste them into the Azure CLI in the browser using shift + insert.  

 
```bash
sudo sed -i '/PermitRootLogin/c\PermitRootLogin yes' /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

sudo echo -e "tester\ntester" | sudo passwd root 

sudo systemctl restart sshd 

dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com 
```

3. Open WinSCP. Enter YOUR Virtual Machine IP address in the Host name box. Make sure you put root in the User name box and in the Password box put tester then click login.

5. Finally, you should be logged in like below. Your local windows machine files are on the left and your remote Linux VM files are on the right. Drag and drop files in either direction.
